# my-project

> A Vue.js project utilizing Google Maps API. Enter your latitude and longitude to display your location on a Google Map. Uses HTML, JavaScript, and Vue.js. I created a Single Page Component and the component was dynamically updated with the form data on the page.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

```
